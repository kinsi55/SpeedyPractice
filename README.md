# SpeedyPractice

*Beat Saber Plugin to increase the maximum song speed multiplier in practice mode*

Beat Saber's practice mode speed multiplier is limited to 200%, but **fear not** as SpeedyPractice comes to the rescue!

~~Beat Saber v1.12.2 fucked up the song speed multiplier slider steps for practice mode so you can't select 100% anymore, but **fear not** as SpeedyPractice comes to the rescue!~~

~~Beat Saber v1.12.1 has decreased the maximum song speed multiplier accessible via practice mode to 150%, but **fear not** as SpeedyPractice comes to the rescue!~~

SpeedyPractice increases the maximum speed multiplier to 300% but you can also change this value in the config file at `Beat Saber\UserData\SpeedyPractice.json`.  
Additionally, you can change the minimum speed multiplier and the slider step size in the config file.
