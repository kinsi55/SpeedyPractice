# SpeedyPractice

*Beat Saber Plugin to increase the maximum song speed multiplier in practice mode*

Beat Saber v1.12.1 has decreased the maximum song speed multiplier accessible via practice mode to 150%, but **fear not** as SpeedyPractice comes to the rescue!

SpeedyPractice increases the multiplier to 200% by default but this is configurable in the config file at `Beat Saber\UserData\SpeedyPractice.json`. The slider will increase in steps of 5%, just like in the base game.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release] of SpeedyPractice.
1. Extract the contents of the zip into your Beat Saber directory.
